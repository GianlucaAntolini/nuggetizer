{"query": "how rent seeking tactics lead to forced and blocked exchagnes", "qid": "2024-76908", "answer_text": "Also, since limits to competition can be a driver for prices, consumers may be required to pay more. Issues Arising from Rent Seeking Rent seeking can disrupt market efficiencies and create pricing disadvantages for market participants. It has been known to cause limited competition and high barriers to entry. Those that benefit from successful rent seeking obtain added economic rents without any added obligations. This can potentially create unfair advantages, specifically providing wealth to certain businesses that leads to greater market share at the detriment of competitors. Policies sought by rent-seeking result in an inefficient use of resources. Rent-Seeking policies may prove so destructive that they cause resources to sit idle. An important caveat of this waste is that it is irrelevant whether or not the rent seeker achieves the sought-after policy goal. What triggers this wasted is the fact that time, effort, and resources were diverted away from producing goods or rendering services that others are willing to buy for and instead used to influence policy for private gain. In the case of government resources, it may b that scarce government revenue is used t o create \u0430 special interest tax subsidy instead of investing in research or infrastructure that would be more beneficial to society as e whole. Private resources may also be misallocated.
