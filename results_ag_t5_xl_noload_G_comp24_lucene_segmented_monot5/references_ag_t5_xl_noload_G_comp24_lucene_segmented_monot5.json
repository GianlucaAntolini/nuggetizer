When you look across cultures, you will find that people have had a wide range of beliefs about gender. Some cultures look at people and see six genders, while others see two. Some cultures have created specific ways for people to live in roles that are different from that assigned to them at birth. In addition, different cultures also vary in their definitions of masculine and feminine. Whether we view someone as transgender depends on the cultural lenses we are looking through as well as how people identify themselves.

Additional research found that males tend to be associated with stronger and more active characteristics than females (Best, 2001); however recent research argues that culture shapes how some gender stereotypes are perceived. Researchers found that across cultures, individualistic traits were viewed as more masculine; however, collectivist cultures rated masculine traits as collectivist and not individualist (Cuddy et al., 2015). These findings provide support that gender stereotypes may be moderated by cultural values. There are two major psychological theories that partially explain how children form their own gender roles after they learn to differentiate based on gender. Gender schema theory argues that children are active learners who essentially socialize themselves and actively organize others’ behavior, activities, and attributes into gender categories, which are known as schemas. These schemas then affect what children notice and remember later."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_00_472761851#11_868089541", "doc": {"segment": "whilst this (and other evidence) might imply that it is also important in humans it is fair to suggest that the formation of pair bonds in humans is influenced by a range of additional factors including learning and culture” (para. 8).

When inhaled, plutonium can also cause lung cancer. However, because the human body still slightly prefers iron to plutonium for its biological processes, that preference could potentially provide avenues for treating plutonium exposure, by flooding such receptors and preventing plutonium from being taken in by the cells, the study authors noted. In addition, a 2005 study in the journal Current Medicinal Chemistry found that there are some short-term treatments for plutonium exposure. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s identified agents, such as Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic, which can help the body remove plutonium faster. Other drugs, such as ones used to treat iron-processing disorders such as beta-thalassemia, or bone-strengthening drugs that treat osteoporosis, may also be useful for plutonium exposure, the study found.

A white count of 15,000 (with a white count being slang for elevated white blood cells, or WBCs) is often a sign of an infection, as most labs will have a normal value that is somewhat less than that. Many things can cause this leukocytosis (which is another way to describe an increase in white blood cells), but most commonly it has something to do with an infection. See a doctor who can help\nFind Infectious disease specialists near you\nI recommend that you speak with your doctor. The fact that you have hot flashes, sore joints, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms all can indicate that some sort of infection is ongoing. Your doctor should be able to help you by recommending the appropriate treatment and testing that is needed to determine what is causing your symptoms. Often, doctors will prescribe an antibiotic before knowing exactly what is causing the infection (ie, whether the infection is from a virus or a bacteria). This can often be considered empiric therapy, which has a role in some situations."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_18_512963387#2_575789127", "doc": {"segment": "One such attempt is the Rochester criteria.

One of his sixth-grade students, a Kosovo-Albanian boy, had drifted far off the learning grid, resisting his teacher’s best efforts. The school’s team of special educators—including a social worker, a nurse and a psychologist—convinced Louhivuori that laziness was not to blame. So he decided to hold the boy back a year, a measure so rare in Finland it’s practically obsolete. Finland has vastly improved in reading, math and science literacy over the past decade in large part because its teachers are trusted to do whatever it takes to turn young lives around. This 13-year-old, Besart Kabashi, received something akin to royal tutoring. “I took Besart on that year as my private student,” Louhivuori told me in his office, which boasted a Beatles “Yellow Submarine” poster on the wall and an electric guitar in the closet."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_25_778507423#1_1491003921", "doc": {"segment": "As a mom going back to school, you’re not only actualizing your own educational and career goals but also inspiring your children to believe in the power of a good education — to reach higher and dream bigger.

If this is the case, seek help to learn more effective study skills before returning to college.

Finally, find a mentor in college who can help you stay motivated and give you that extra push during crunch time. Try a Different School\nIf you’re on academic suspension, it doesn’t mean that you can’t go to college somewhere else. Consider attending a community college to take care of some general education credits or to earn your associate degree. If you want to return to your original college, demonstrating success in a community college will bolster your chances.

Issues Arising from Rent Seeking\nRent seeking can disrupt market efficiencies and create pricing disadvantages for market participants. It has been known to cause limited competition and high barriers to entry. Those that benefit from successful rent seeking obtain added economic rents without any added obligations. This can potentially create unfair advantages, specifically providing wealth to certain businesses that leads to greater market share at the detriment of competitors. Lastly, rent seeking wealth is typically a function of taxpayer funding. These tax revenues are used to provide economic wealth for rent seekers but may or may not improve the economic climate or produce any benefits for taxpayers-at-large. This can lead to disparaging funds that lack regeneration and require higher taxes in the future."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_32_1624237873#7_3568644175", "doc": {"segment": "Policies sought by rent-seeking result in an inefficient use of resources.

What triggers this waste is the fact that time, effort, and resources were diverted away from producing goods or rendering services that others are willing to pay for and instead used to influence policy for private gain. The second economic concern of rent-seeking behavior is that the policy positions sought and protected create a misallocation of government or private resources. In the case of government resources, it may be that scarce government revenue is used to create a special interest tax subsidy instead of investing in research or infrastructure that would be more beneficial to society as a whole. Private resources may also be misallocated. Without proper regulations, for example, banks may overleverage themselves if they believe that the federal government will bail them out.

While rent-seeking exists in both private and public forms, the scope of this paper is the discussion public rent-seeking and specifically two public rent-seeking activities—lobbying and campaign funding.

Not only do people spend more time and money trying to get a bigger piece of the economic pie for themselves rather than trying to enlarge the pie, but the policies they seek are often wasteful, inefficient, or even harmful. If rent-seeking is a successful strategy for businesses or individuals, it can impose great harm on society by slowing or even stopping economic growth. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explains, rent-seeking not only wastes tax dollars on unnecessary or inefficient projects—redistributing money from one part of society to the rent-seekers—but it is a “centripetal force” that hollows out the economy because “the rewards of rent seeking become so outsize that more and more energy is directed toward it, at the expense of everything else.” While it is impossible to quantify the economic harm done by rent-seeking to the American economy, this issue brief reviews the literature and finds that the harm is likely quite significant. Certainly, not all money in politics is spent for the purpose of capturing private favors, but there is evidence that at least a significant percentage of it is. Most Americans do not make campaign contributions or lobby politicians.

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down two campaign finance provisions in the past few years that limited independent political expenditures by corporations and other organizations and placed aggregate limits on individual donations. The Court found that the provisions infringe on the right of free speech and that the aggregate limits do not prevent a narrowly defined version of corruption.

He allowed non-landed Romans to join the army (previously, they’d been required to own property). At the same time, he changed the law so that soldiers had to carry their own equipment (such men became known as “Marius’ Mules”). He also held the elected office of Consul an unprecedented seven times from 107 BCE – though the position became increasingly autocratic, with his “election” more to do with the granting of emergency powers to fight off invading hordes than with the application of the constitution. Marius also made a name for himself as a General of considerable acumen in several campaigns, especially in Africa and against German tribes. Notoriously, he defeated the Teutones as they advanced into Italy (the tribe had agreed a two-pronged attack on the country with a fellow Germanic tribe, the Cimbri, from their positions in Gaul), ambushing the hordes on the edge of the Alps and killing a reputed 100,000 invaders.

Lawmakers in both the Senate and Assembly introduced the legislation Monday, seeking to tack a 12.5 percent tax onto the state's 14.5 cent motor fuels and petroleum tax in order to spend $20 billion over the next 10 years on infrastructure improvements.

On the one hand, the ability of public school teachers to speak freely in the classroom is somewhat limited because public school officials can ensure teachers do not violate the Establishment Clause by endorsing a particular religious viewpoint or requiring students to participate in religious activities. The religious expression of students is private expression fully protected by the First Amendment. A public school may regulate the content of speech when the student’s expression is actually sponsored or encouraged by the school. Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe in 2000 held that school-sponsored prayer at high school football games violated the First Amendment even though it was delivered by a student representing the student body. As noted in Tinker, school officials also can regulate speech when the expression causes an actual disruption in the school’s operation, according to the Tinker case. So long as students conduct themselves in a non-harassing and non-disruptive manner, public schools must allow students to express their religious views on the same terms as they allow other forms of expression. What’s Permissible? An issue public school administrators and teachers often confront is the appropriate role that religion may play during instructional time in the classroom. There is a key difference between “religious activity” or “religious instruction” in the classroom — that is between instructing students that the tenets of one religion are true and should be followed, which is not permitted, and teaching about religion, such as what members of various religions believe, which is permitted."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_13_72049552#9_181545041", "doc": {"segment": "Religion should be taught in school, as this is the only way to return to society the forgotten moral standards and true values.

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that by forcing religion-based companies to fund what they consider the immoral act of abortion, the Affordable Care Act placed an unconstitutionally “substantial burden” on those companies.

Those payments could be an illegal kickback in violation of the federal health care law. The Justice Department issued a subpoena to the corporation for records of patients referred to the lab and payments it received. As the only employee of the organization, the doctor would have to serve as its “custodian of records” by turning over documents that could be used to prosecute him later if he received any kickbacks. Under the Fifth Amendment, an individual can refuse to respond to a subpoena if the act of producing records could be used against the person in a subsequent prosecution.

In response, automakers cut orders for microchips. At the same time, the demand for consumer electronics—notably the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, as well as laptops and desktops for working from home—skyrocketed.

Likewise, but for different reasons, Toyota reduced output of the Tundra at its San Antonio plant, and similarly FCA and Honda have reduced output at some of their plants due to the chip shortage. What Has Caused this Shortage? The shortage of semiconductors is occurring as a result of the companies that manufacture these products have allocated more of their production volume to meet the surging demand from the consumer-electronics industry, which saw sales of electronics products spike during the stay-at-home mandates created by the pandemic. While the auto industry buys a lot of semiconductors and electronics, it is small compared to what the consumer electronics industry purchases; the consumer electronics industry is a much bigger customer for these components than the auto industry. To put this in perspective, while there may be 100 million vehicles built per year worldwide, this compares to 1 billion smartphones manufactured each year. And smartphones are only one segment of the much larger consumer electronics industry. So, there is a lot of competition for a finite inventory of electronics and semiconductors that will continue until production can increase to meet demand."}}]}

The role of the observer in quantum mechanics\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, which was the prevailing theory at the time, proposed that atoms or photons exist in multiple states that correspond with different possible outcomes and the possibilites , called superpositions, do not commit to a definite state until they are observed. Schrödinger's thought experiment was designed to show what the Copenhagen interpretation would look like if the mathematical terminology used to explain superposition in the microscopic world was replaced by macroscopic terms the average person could visualize and understand. In the experiment, the observer cannot know whether or not an atom of the substance has decayed, and consequently, does not know whether the vial has broken and the cat has been killed. According to quantum law under the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat will be both dead and alive until someone looks in the box. In quantum mechanics lingo, the cat's ability to be both alive and dead until it is observed is referred to as quantum indeterminacy or the observer's paradox. The logic behind the observer's paradox is the proven ability of observation to influence outcomes.

Instead, what would happen according to quantum physics is that the universe could exist as a superposition of states, unfolding simultaneously in every possible permutation, until such a time when an observer springs up in one such possible universe.

Some quantum physicists (e.g. Don Page and William Wootters) have developed a theory that time is actually an emergent phenomenon resulting from a strange quantum concept known as entanglement, in which different quantum particles effectively share an existence, even though physically separated, so that the quantum state of each particle can only be described relative to the other entangled particles.

In 2007, an off-duty police officer having an early Valentine’s Day dinner with his wife shot and killed an 18-year-old gunman at an Ogden, Utah, mall, stopping a rampage where five people died. “ There is no question that his quick actions saved the lives of numerous other people,” then-police chief Chris Burbank said at the time. In 2010, another off-duty police officer drew his personal weapon and fired when a man attacked an AT&T store in New York Mills, N.Y. The attacker was killed before he could carry out a plan to murder several employees at the store. And in 2012, a young shooter killed two people and wounded three others during a rampage at Clackamas Town Center before a man carrying a lawful personal weapon drew it and pointed it at the man.

In the early twentieth century, access to higher education was considered to be the exclusive domain of those who were members of the so-called “leisure classes.” The rationale behind this exclusivity was that the American masses engaged in either manufacturing or agricultural labor, and so did not require extensive schooling in the humanities, the arts, or philosophy. However, with the need for an educated managerial class with the maturing of the Industrial Revolution, it became clear that the doors of higher education should be opened to a wider cross-section of Americans. With the implementation of the G.I. Bill of 1944, which was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in an effort to provide a reward for patriotic young men who had served valiantly in World War II, the United States government began to provide taxpayer funds to pay the college tuition of Americans who could not afford higher education otherwise (Rose, 2016)."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_24_1418385581#0_3028698932", "doc": {"segment": "Facet of Process Philosophy Impacting American Government - Free Paper Sample\nMy Paper Writer\nAbout\nPricing\nHow It Works\nServices\nResearch paper help\nEconomic research papers\nManagement paper writing\nSociology papers\nAnalysis papers\nEditing service\nProofreading service\nWriting papers for money\nAction term paper\nAccounting term papers\nBusiness term papers\nEssay writing service\nEnglish term papers\nPersonal statement\nResearch proposal\nResearch paper writing service\nCustom college papers\nTerm paper writing service\nWrite my college paper\nWrite my term paper\nWrite my research paper\nPay someone to write my paper\nWrite my essay\nRewrite my paper\nContact\nSign In\nOrder Now\nSign In\nOrder Now\nAbout\nPricing\nHow It Works\nServices\nResearch paper help\nEconomic research papers\nManagement paper writing\nSociology papers\nAnalysis papers\nEditing service\nProofreading service\nWriting papers for money\nAction term paper\nAccounting term papers\nBusiness term papers\nEssay writing service\nEnglish term papers\nPersonal statement\nResearch proposal\nResearch paper writing service\nCustom college papers\nTerm paper writing service\nWrite my college paper\nWrite my term paper\nWrite my research paper\nPay someone to write my paper\nWrite my essay\nContact\nSamples Philosophy Facet of Process Philosophy Impacting American Government\nPaper Details: Category: Philosophy\nPages: 4 page (s)\nWords: 1014 words\nDate added: December 26, 2019\nViews: 121 Views\nCategories\nMarketing Management Shakespeare Linguistics Law Religion Biology Society War Ethics\nFacet of Process Philosophy Impacting American Government\nProcess philosophy is a branch of philosophy which asserts that all aspects of reality are subject to change, and that there is no facet of reality which can be considered to be static.

A new expansion of federally-funded unemployment benefits means that many workers filing for unemployment benefits will have access to additional weeks of benefits and larger weekly checks than was available before the pandemic. These expanded benefits can help jobless workers put food on the table for their families while the economy is shut down to slow the spread of the virus.

The $2.2 trillion package included various provisions increasing and expanding unemployment insurance benefits available to workers, including individuals who are unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable to work due to COVID-19. How does the CARES Act increase existing unemployment insurance benefits? The CARES Act expands existing unemployment benefits in two material ways: ( 1) providing for an extra $600 weekly payment, in addition to the weekly benefit amount an eligible employee otherwise receives under state law; and (2) increases the maximum number of weeks an individual may receive benefits. These new benefits are funded at the federal level, but will be administered by the states. Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (“FPUC”). Under the FPUC provision of the Act, individuals who are eligible for unemployment benefits will receive an extra $600 weekly benefit for all weeks of unemployment between April 5, 2020 and July 31, 2020, in addition to the amount the individual otherwise would be entitled to receive under state law.

Just 100 years ago, it was immodest to talk about how much money you made, and it was advised against to brag about your children’s accomplishments (for example), for fear that they would get “big heads” and “inflated egos.” Fast-forward to the turn of the century, where the advent of the internet and social media changed everything. Soon enough, it was socially acceptable not only to share your accomplishments, but to shamelessly brag about them too with the virtual guarantee that you would be praised and validated.

Goal 14 also requires cities and counties to plan for growth in population and employment and that this growth is to be contained inside urban growth boundaries. Counties are not expected, or allowed, to plan for expected growth to occur outside urban growth boundaries. Containing growth inside urban growth boundaries reduces the pressure to convert farmland around cities to subdivisions, stores, and offices. What are the primary components of Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) zoning? Counties apply EFU zoning to agricultural lands protected under Statewide Planning Goal 3. EFU zoning is based on local comprehensive plans, which are adopted in accordance with state requirements."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_315974302#7_698446869", "doc": {"segment": "The upper left corner of the city screen shows how much of each resource the city is producing. Depending on what resources the empire, or that particular city, needs, consider carefully where to assign citizens and also consider what improvements should be constructed on the surrounding lands to improve upon the base yield (especially Farms to increase Growth and increased population); additionally, always have a strategy for the long-term development of a city, and use it to determine what buildings to build in it, and in what order. Population Growth\nThe population growth of a city, or the birth of new citizens, is determined by the city's available Food. The more Food a city is producing, the faster its population will grow. For more details about Food and Population growth, check this article. Population growth will slow dramatically if an empire is not Happy. Producing items\nEvery city has the ability to produce buildings, units, or projects. The availability of each depends on whether the technology unlocking it has been researched, and whether its prerequisites have been met. For example, certain buildings may only be built if a city is in a tile adjacent to a coast, or if a certain type of building has already been built in all of a civilization's cities, etc."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_40_725904043#12_1420053262", "doc": {"segment": "Future-ready technology can solve many congestion issues facing urban populations by facilitating a more efficient transportation ecosystem. To reduce traffic congestion and pollution further, cities will have to consider technology that provides parking solutions to reduce the number of cars driving around on the roads. Cities can work with hospitals, businesses, and hotels (all traffic-heavy enterprises) to create an efficient answer to parking and traffic issues. City planners also have to consider either controlling their population growth or expanding their city – and how to economically prepare and adapt for these changes. Create Opportunities\nTo combat unemployment and crime, urbanized cities must create more job opportunities to accommodate their citizens. It will be essential for urbanized cities to foster job growth and creation by working with new technologies, creating new and innovative companies within its city, and considering new global markets."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_26_937737857#0_1856090880", "doc": {"segment": "How Do Cities Grow?

One of the fundamental requirements of a market analysis is the ability to understand the economics of the location. In order to fully understand the value that a property in its current or planned use brings to a market, one must consider the economics of urban growth patterns as well as the overall market activity and health of the area. Both the current value and forecasted trends in rent, property value, and vacancy depend upon an understanding of how cities grow and how those urban development trends ultimately influence real estate values throughout the city. Of course, cities can grow in many different ways and understanding the patterns of urban growth can help clarify the big picture in a real estate analysis. In this post we’ll discuss several different urban growth models that are commonly used to explain the growth patterns of cities. Concentric Circle Growth in Urban Development\nThe concentric circle growth model, or CCD model, was one of the first theoretical models of urban development. A sociologist named Ernest Burgess first developed this model in 1925. The urban development patterns in Chicago were the inspiration for the concentric circle growth model."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_315385347#4_697701628", "doc": {"segment": "Ecstatic: If a city has at least 3 more Amenities than required, all of the city's non-food yields increase by +10%, and its Population growth increases by +20%.

Atlanta Tech Village in Buckhead, a collaborative space for tech startups. Courtesy of choateco.com\nAtlanta is still a city of growth, but perhaps these days should be considered a city of growth potential. Burgeoning industries, relatively low cost of living, pleasant weather and new urbanism projects definitely have appeal for the young and mobile. Even their parents are seeing the benefits of in-town living. If the City can figure out how to make them stay (maybe by finally getting around to that MARTA expansion), then Atlanta might truly be in business.

Concentric circle growth starts with a central business district at the heart of the city. Everything grows up around this central hub of economic activity for the city. The concentric circle growth model is an application of bid-rent theory. Those who are able to pay the highest rents are located near the economic hub of the central business district. Real estate prices are lower as you move away from the central business district, but then people also need to consider transportation time and costs to get to work in the central business district."}}]}
