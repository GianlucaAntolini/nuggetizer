When you look across cultures, you will find that people have had a wide range of beliefs about gender. Some cultures look at people and see six genders, while others see two. Some cultures have created specific ways for people to live in roles that are different from that assigned to them at birth. In addition, different cultures also vary in their definitions of masculine and feminine. Whether we view someone as transgender depends on the cultural lenses we are looking through as well as how people identify themselves.

Additional research found that males tend to be associated with stronger and more active characteristics than females (Best, 2001); however recent research argues that culture shapes how some gender stereotypes are perceived. Researchers found that across cultures, individualistic traits were viewed as more masculine; however, collectivist cultures rated masculine traits as collectivist and not individualist (Cuddy et al., 2015). These findings provide support that gender stereotypes may be moderated by cultural values. There are two major psychological theories that partially explain how children form their own gender roles after they learn to differentiate based on gender. Gender schema theory argues that children are active learners who essentially socialize themselves and actively organize others’ behavior, activities, and attributes into gender categories, which are known as schemas. These schemas then affect what children notice and remember later."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_00_472761851#11_868089541", "doc": {"segment": "whilst this (and other evidence) might imply that it is also important in humans it is fair to suggest that the formation of pair bonds in humans is influenced by a range of additional factors including learning and culture” (para. 8).

When inhaled, plutonium can also cause lung cancer. However, because the human body still slightly prefers iron to plutonium for its biological processes, that preference could potentially provide avenues for treating plutonium exposure, by flooding such receptors and preventing plutonium from being taken in by the cells, the study authors noted. In addition, a 2005 study in the journal Current Medicinal Chemistry found that there are some short-term treatments for plutonium exposure. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s identified agents, such as Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic, which can help the body remove plutonium faster. Other drugs, such as ones used to treat iron-processing disorders such as beta-thalassemia, or bone-strengthening drugs that treat osteoporosis, may also be useful for plutonium exposure, the study found.

A white count of 15,000 (with a white count being slang for elevated white blood cells, or WBCs) is often a sign of an infection, as most labs will have a normal value that is somewhat less than that. Many things can cause this leukocytosis (which is another way to describe an increase in white blood cells), but most commonly it has something to do with an infection. See a doctor who can help\nFind Infectious disease specialists near you\nI recommend that you speak with your doctor. The fact that you have hot flashes, sore joints, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms all can indicate that some sort of infection is ongoing. Your doctor should be able to help you by recommending the appropriate treatment and testing that is needed to determine what is causing your symptoms. Often, doctors will prescribe an antibiotic before knowing exactly what is causing the infection (ie, whether the infection is from a virus or a bacteria). This can often be considered empiric therapy, which has a role in some situations."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_18_512963387#2_575789127", "doc": {"segment": "One such attempt is the Rochester criteria.

Evolution of Russian Energy Strategies\nEnergy's usefulness as a means of achieving Russia's three main imperatives has altered over time because Russia has had to change its strategies depending on shifts in domestic or international circumstances. Moscow's strength lies in its flexibility in managing its energy sector. The importance of Russian energy was established in the late 1800s, when the monarchy saw great potential for the Russian Empire if it could develop this sector on a large scale. However, the empire had neither the technology nor the capital to start up an indigenous energy industry. As a solution, the monarchy eased its foreign investment restrictions, inviting European and U.S. firms to develop the Baku and Volga oil fields. This brought about a brief period of warmer relations between the Russian Empire and many Western partners, particularly the United Kingdom, France and the United States. All parties soon realized that the only way to make the Russian oil business profitable despite the high costs associated with the country's harsh and vast geography was to transform Russia into a massive producer.

Gazprom’s new grand vision in Europe is to build pipelines to the EU border and from there its clients are expected to take gas to their home markets. As part of this vision, it also commits not to use Ukrainian pipelines after 2019. So if Europeans need Russian gas they should build the missing links connecting to Gazprom’s proposed pipelines – the Turkish Stream and the recently-announced expansion of the Nord Stream link – themselves, or so goes the current thinking in Gazprom and the Kremlin. However, neither Turkish nor Western companies are rushing to build these pipelines. What is left for European energy security is the possibility that Western energy companies may take risks in dealing with Ukraine’s transit issues post-2019.

Consider someone with strong political beliefs on either end of the political spectrum. They may only turn to news sources that align with their beliefs.

Because people have a tendency to not question the facts offered by their news source of choice, it’s not likely that someone would do any type of fact checking. Furthermore, some news sources offer misinformation or leave any conflicting views out of their segments, so sticking to a single news source is a powerful example of confirmation bias. Also, with so many news sources available, if you hold a strong opinion on anything –no matter how unpopular your belief is– you’re more than likely able to find some source that agrees with you. Research has shown that a scientific approach (which has not yet been identified) is needed to ameliorate this problem. One potential approach is to have social media platforms develop algorithms to only display content from news sources that users deem as being high-quality and trustworthy.

Some types of bias in the media are intentional. A number of editors and reporters have the propensity to deliberately commit partiality because of their personal stances. However, some incidents of bias are unintentional. For example, cognitive biases result from the inability of a media person to demonstrate objectivity and make necessary judgments because of the limitations of his or her cognitive processes. These limitations may be due to predefined preferences or having a certain frame of mind that unconsciously affects the way a particular story is presented. Another example is when a reporter lacks competencies in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data or facts, thereby resulting in misinterpretation and misrepresentations.

Environmental Theories of Homicide\nEnvironmental theories can be described generally as focusing on sources or causes of homicidal behavior outside the individual. Examples of such theories include socialization theories, symbolic interactionism, social structural theories, control theory, and social ecology theory. Socialization theories of homicide and aggression have historically been among the most popular and influential accounts of the motivations for homicide. The sex difference in the commission of violent crimes— including homicide—was one of the first and most obvious observations demanding explanation. Men are more often than women both the offenders and the victims of homicides. Socialization theories argue that men, more than women, have been socialized to view aggression as a permissible means to achieve certain ends. This differential socialization for aggressive behavior in men and women, it is argued, can explain the greater homicide rates among men. While this theory has been well received within psychology, there is growing evidence that an exclusive reliance on this theoretical position to explain homicide patterns leads to incomplete conclusions."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_39_528214426#1_1136576959", "doc": {"segment": "This essay we will provide an epidemiological assessment of victimization against the elderly based on U.S. statistics and show how this victimization varies across the life course.

Recently Jonathan Bate, Karl Kroeber, Jim McKusick, Onno Oerlemans, and Kate Rigby have published important books on the subject, [1] and The Wordsworth Circle, Studies in Romanticism, and Romantic Circles Praxis Series have published special issues on the topic. [ 2] By and large, these books and the articles in the collections argue that we can trace the origins of our current ecological thinking to European Romanticism in general, and sometimes to British and American Romanticism in particular. A similar trend to link various strands of our current environmental thinking to Romantic ur-texts may be found in the works of environmental historians, geographers, and environmentalists, such as Neal Evernden, Max Oelschlager, I. G. Simmons, and Donald Worster, among others. In Worster's Nature's Economy, a key history of ecological thought, we read that \"at the very core of [the] Romantic view of nature was what later generations would come to call an ecological perspective: that is, a search for holistic or integrated perception, an emphasis on interdependence and relatedness in nature, and an intense desire to restore man to a place of intimate intercourse with the vast organism that constitutes the earth\" (82). More recently, in his introduction to \"Romanticism and Ecology,\" a special issue of The Wordsworth Circle, Jim McKusick pointedly and rightly, I think, claims that \"much Romantic writing emerges from a desperate sense of alienation from the natural world and expresses an anxious endeavor to re-establish a vital, sustainable relationship between mankind and the fragile planet on which [we] dwell\" (123). These statements point to a position that many recent writers have defended, albeit from divergent and importantly nuanced perspectives: Romantic literature is a germinal site for the rise of ecological consciousness and practices. The affiliation between Romanticism and ecology nonetheless remains problematic."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_397081528#2_837086620", "doc": {"segment": "For the Romantics, nature was innocent, something to protect against industrial development and urban expansion. This view placed children in a new perspective. The notion of children's proximity to nature remained the same, but its significance changed. The Romantics mourned maturing children's progressive acculturation and alienation from nature. They wished to mitigate the process that predecessors had striven to accelerate. The impulse to protect children's innocence -- the very notion of children's innocence -- is a Romantic legacy. 3 Individualism\nAttempts to recover the lost wisdom of childhood led Romantics to reflection and introspection. This fascination with subjectivity contributed to the Romantic Movement's veneration of individualism. Romantic individualism, however, is hardly confined to the period from 1770 to 1840. Writing in 1830, Victor Hugo called Romanticism \"liberalism in literature,\" and despite 21st-century politics' specialized use of \"liberalism,\" the term chiefly denotes an assumption of inborn autonomy, free will and personal liberty."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_20_499791837#1_1097074670", "doc": {"segment": "Access Full Document\nPlease Sign Up\nto get full document.

The Industrial Revolution was a time of all work and no play and spanned from about 1800 to 1850. The industrialization and urbanization of major cities led to horrid cities and ghastly working conditions. The children of this era saw these things and wanted to escape, thus creating the Romantic Period. One of those people wanting to escape was writer Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. This romantic novel tells a story of scientist Victor Frankenstein and the making of his revolting creature. In Frankenstein Shelley conveys many of the key characteristics of romantic novel through incorporating the love for nature, the yearning for isolationism and the freedom of emotion.

Meditate during a solar eclipse\nFact\nWhile it is a good habit to meditate daily, especially in the morning, it is specifically advisable to meditate during a solar eclipse. This is because of the connection that the mind has with the moon and the body has with the earth. As the sun is connected to both the mind and body, when all three celestial bodies are aligned, so is the body with the mind, making it a perfect time to meditate.

It contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. For broader world history, recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the 4th millennium BC, and coincides with the invention of writing. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals. Recorded history for particular types of information is therefore limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic. The interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method, or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility of an effective method for interpreting recorded history, is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_22_275010492#10_670646376", "doc": {"segment": "Most modern historical depictions of Europe do not reflect the multicultural reality.

They also built ethnic enclaves in the Midwest metropolises of Milwaukee and Chicago. Many Germans were farmers, bringing with them their Old World practices. Others were craftsmen such as furniture-makers, brewers, metalworkers and engineers. Many of these craftsmen joined the growing urban factories, to which they introduced their craft guild tradition. This tradition soon evolved into trade unions, and from there the labor union movement emerged, reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th century. Politics\nMany Germans who immigrated in the 1850s did so as a result of the failed democratic revolutions of 1830 and 1848 in Vienna, Berlin and much of southwest Germany. They carried their political aspirations to America, where they formed a significant voting bloc, and introduced political ideologies such as anarchism and socialism to their new communities."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_472358135#3_1093402177", "doc": {"segment": "German immigrants placed great emphasis on early public education, which they enjoyed in their homeland.

One of his sixth-grade students, a Kosovo-Albanian boy, had drifted far off the learning grid, resisting his teacher’s best efforts. The school’s team of special educators—including a social worker, a nurse and a psychologist—convinced Louhivuori that laziness was not to blame. So he decided to hold the boy back a year, a measure so rare in Finland it’s practically obsolete. Finland has vastly improved in reading, math and science literacy over the past decade in large part because its teachers are trusted to do whatever it takes to turn young lives around. This 13-year-old, Besart Kabashi, received something akin to royal tutoring. “I took Besart on that year as my private student,” Louhivuori told me in his office, which boasted a Beatles “Yellow Submarine” poster on the wall and an electric guitar in the closet."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_25_778507423#1_1491003921", "doc": {"segment": "As a mom going back to school, you’re not only actualizing your own educational and career goals but also inspiring your children to believe in the power of a good education — to reach higher and dream bigger.

Issues Arising from Rent Seeking\nRent seeking can disrupt market efficiencies and create pricing disadvantages for market participants. It has been known to cause limited competition and high barriers to entry. Those that benefit from successful rent seeking obtain added economic rents without any added obligations. This can potentially create unfair advantages, specifically providing wealth to certain businesses that leads to greater market share at the detriment of competitors. Lastly, rent seeking wealth is typically a function of taxpayer funding. These tax revenues are used to provide economic wealth for rent seekers but may or may not improve the economic climate or produce any benefits for taxpayers-at-large.

The second economic concern of rent-seeking behavior is that the policy positions sought and protected create a misallocation of government or private resources. In the case of government resources, it may be that scarce government revenue is used to create a special interest tax subsidy instead of investing in research or infrastructure that would be more beneficial to society as a whole. Private resources may also be misallocated. Without proper regulations, for example, banks may overleverage themselves if they believe that the federal government will bail them out.

If rent-seeking is a successful strategy for businesses or individuals, it can impose great harm on society by slowing or even stopping economic growth. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explains, rent-seeking not only wastes tax dollars on unnecessary or inefficient projects—redistributing money from one part of society to the rent-seekers—but it is a “centripetal force” that hollows out the economy because “the rewards of rent seeking become so outsize that more and more energy is directed toward it, at the expense of everything else.” While it is impossible to quantify the economic harm done by rent-seeking to the American economy, this issue brief reviews the literature and finds that the harm is likely quite significant. Certainly, not all money in politics is spent for the purpose of capturing private favors, but there is evidence that at least a significant percentage of it is.

Once the Senate lost control over its legions and generals, the power swayed into the hands of powerful men and generals of the Republic.

Gaius Marius (157-86 BCE)\nGeneral and Consul of the Republic\nMarius is attributed with a number of actions that had significant influence on the transformation of the Roman civilisation from Republic to Empire. He allowed non-landed Romans to join the army (previously, they’d been required to own property). At the same time, he changed the law so that soldiers had to carry their own equipment (such men became known as “Marius’ Mules”). He also held the elected office of Consul an unprecedented seven times from 107 BCE – though the position became increasingly autocratic, with his “election” more to do with the granting of emergency powers to fight off invading hordes than with the application of the constitution. Marius also made a name for himself as a General of considerable acumen in several campaigns, especially in Africa and against German tribes. Notoriously, he defeated the Teutones as they advanced into Italy (the tribe had agreed a two-pronged attack on the country with a fellow Germanic tribe, the Cimbri, from their positions in Gaul), ambushing the hordes on the edge of the Alps and killing a reputed 100,000 invaders.

Men from the provinces could now sign up to serve in the Roman army, and in time become Roman citizens themselves.

However, he is best known for the changes he brought about to the Roman military legions, dramatic and influential reforms that forever changed the rules of engagement.

Lawmakers in both the Senate and Assembly introduced the legislation Monday, seeking to tack a 12.5 percent tax onto the state's 14.5 cent motor fuels and petroleum tax in order to spend $20 billion over the next 10 years on infrastructure improvements.

On the one hand, the ability of public school teachers to speak freely in the classroom is somewhat limited because public school officials can ensure teachers do not violate the Establishment Clause by endorsing a particular religious viewpoint or requiring students to participate in religious activities. The religious expression of students is private expression fully protected by the First Amendment. A public school may regulate the content of speech when the student’s expression is actually sponsored or encouraged by the school. Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe in 2000 held that school-sponsored prayer at high school football games violated the First Amendment even though it was delivered by a student representing the student body. As noted in Tinker, school officials also can regulate speech when the expression causes an actual disruption in the school’s operation, according to the Tinker case. So long as students conduct themselves in a non-harassing and non-disruptive manner, public schools must allow students to express their religious views on the same terms as they allow other forms of expression. What’s Permissible? An issue public school administrators and teachers often confront is the appropriate role that religion may play during instructional time in the classroom.

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that by forcing religion-based companies to fund what they consider the immoral act of abortion, the Affordable Care Act placed an unconstitutionally “substantial burden” on those companies.

The Justice Department issued a subpoena to the corporation for records of patients referred to the lab and payments it received. As the only employee of the organization, the doctor would have to serve as its “custodian of records” by turning over documents that could be used to prosecute him later if he received any kickbacks. Under the Fifth Amendment, an individual can refuse to respond to a subpoena if the act of producing records could be used against the person in a subsequent prosecution.

Pauses to production can be short lived and can also be introduced rather suddenly, keeping some spokespeople from going into specifics. Kinks in the Supply Chain\nA convergence of macroeconomic and political events led to the semiconductor shortage, Gartner analyst Gupta said. In the spring, demand for cars fell. In response, automakers cut orders for microchips. At the same time, the demand for consumer electronics—notably the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, as well as laptops and desktops for working from home—skyrocketed. Microchip suppliers adjusted production accordingly, and now that car demand has recovered much more quickly than expected, suppliers haven't been ready to respond. \"With lead times of six to nine months, the semiconductor industry has not been able to scale up fast enough to meet this unexpected growth in automotive demand,\" auto supplier Continental told Car and Driver in a statement. \" The bottlenecks from the semiconductor industry are expected to continue well into 2021, causing major disruptions in Continental's production.\" Comezora via Getty\nAdditionally, several moves by the Trump administration in the U.S.-China trade war resulted in fewer semiconductors coming into the marketplace, ultimately exacerbating the low supply, Gupta said."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_47_716586700#8_1539319544", "doc": {"segment": "The severe cold in Texas, as well as fires and earthquakes in Japan, have further cut down on chip production, Autoblog and Driving.ca report.

And Rolls-Royce just had its best Q1 in the company’s history, The Drive reports. Luckily, though, world governments and the semiconductor industry as a whole are stepping up to help with the shortage.

Volkswagen has reduced production in China and Germany as it is having difficulty sourcing microchips for its electronic stability controls and ABS braking systems. Likewise, but for different reasons, Toyota reduced output of the Tundra at its San Antonio plant, and similarly FCA and Honda have reduced output at some of their plants due to the chip shortage. What Has Caused this Shortage? The shortage of semiconductors is occurring as a result of the companies that manufacture these products have allocated more of their production volume to meet the surging demand from the consumer-electronics industry, which saw sales of electronics products spike during the stay-at-home mandates created by the pandemic. While the auto industry buys a lot of semiconductors and electronics, it is small compared to what the consumer electronics industry purchases; the consumer electronics industry is a much bigger customer for these components than the auto industry. To put this in perspective, while there may be 100 million vehicles built per year worldwide, this compares to 1 billion smartphones manufactured each year. And smartphones are only one segment of the much larger consumer electronics industry. So, there is a lot of competition for a finite inventory of electronics and semiconductors that will continue until production can increase to meet demand."}}]}

These artists combined lyrics with a fixation on darkness and depravity with effects-laded guitars, atmospheric basslines and tom-tom heavy or 'tribal' drums. However, it wasn't until Bauhaus released their 1979 single Bela Lugosi's Dead, in reference to the actor who played the 1931 film adaption of Bram Stoker's Dracula, that goth really became recognized as a genre and subculture. Other bands like UK Decay, Southern Death Cult, and The Danse Society were also particularly popular and influential bands during this era. Method 4\nof 16: The Development of Goth Rock\n44\n45\n5\nCOMING SOON\n1\nThe second wave, spearheaded by The Sisters of Mercy, saw a shift in goth's sound. During the mid-80s the genre began to move away from its pure experimental and arty post-punk sound and started to incorporate hard rock elements. The bands' use of the drum machine is particularly notable. Their mainstream success spawned several similar sounding bands, such as Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, The Merry Thoughts, Fields of the Nephilim. Goths evolution saw the beginnings of notable offshoots, including darkwave (Clan of Xymox and Switchblade Symphony) which is post-punk crossed with new wave and synthpop, and ethereal wave (Cocteau Twins)."}}]}

However, if you truly believe something to be true you should have a right to express that opinion, and allow it to be proven or disproven in the arena of public discourse. Will the ignorant always change their minds when challenged? Probably not. But they will never change their minds if left alone to stew in their own bigotry.

Free Speech Allows Free Thinkers\nYou can’t claim to be a free thinker, if you aren’t even allowed to voice those thoughts. Freedom of speech protects this, and encourages it.

Those who are unimpressed by this logical argument can turn to one based on human experience. One can imagine a world in which oracles, soothsayers, prophets, popes, visionaries, imams, or gurus have been vouchsafed with the truth which only they possess and which the rest of us would be foolish, indeed, criminal, to question.

Its main thesis appears to be \"We need to preserve the possibility of good-faith disagreement without dire professional consequences.\" There are those who see free speech as a concept that benefits only the powerful, and then there are those staunch free-speech advocates — myself among them — who view free speech as the most effective tool available for marginalized voices; no meaningful positive social change could occur without it. It took millennia to establish the norm that you can piss people off, especially the powerful, with your speech and it should generally be tolerated.

One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals. Historical basis in art and politics\nActivist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate. In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within visual arts and traditional theatre, blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two. Protest art involves creative works grounded in the act of addressing political or social issues. Protest art is a medium that is accessible to all socioeconomic classes and represents an innovative tool to expand opportunity structures.

This question has led to research in multiple disciplines—including anthropology, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy. Among the most debated theories in this area of work is the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. This theory states that the language a person speaks will affect the way that this person thinks. The theory varies between two main proposals: that language structure determines how individuals perceive the world and that language structure influences the world view of speakers of a given language but does not determine it.

Introduction\nSince the beginning of 2018, the United States and China have increased tariff rates on each other's imports, contributing to fears of a global downturn. In the near-to-medium term, there are several channels through which increased tariffs and continued uncertainty could affect global growth. First, higher tariffs are equivalent to a tax increase, with negative effects on consumption and investment. Second, given China's important role in global value chains, an increase in bilateral tariffs could disrupt supply chains, with significant negative effects on output. Third, increased uncertainty could dampen GDP if firms delay investment and hiring. Finally, the same forces could negatively affect sentiment and roil international financial markets. Outside of these immediate though eventually temporary effects, a persistent increase in tariffs would likely negatively affect the long-run productive capacity of the economy. Higher tariffs could slow the accumulation of capital, shift resources into less productive sectors, reduce the extent of competition, or interfere with the dissemination of technological advances. In this note, we employ a particular model of trade policy effects following Caliendo and Parro (2015) that focuses on the role of tariffs in spurring adverse resource reallocations."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_36_1250317946#1_2580294140", "doc": {"segment": "Learn more\nThe report further provides a list of the top 10 supply chain risks to watch in 2019.

Some companies, however, are turning this risk into opportunity. For example, U.S. motorcycle maker Harley Davidson announced last year that it would shift production of its motorcycles for EU destinations out of the United States to Thailand to avoid EU tariffs. “ During the quarter, we saw proof in the wisdom of our Thailand manufacturing investment,” Harley-Davidson CEO Matt Levatich said April 23 on a first-quarter earnings call. “ The tariff mitigation we realized allowed more competitive pricing and access to more customers.” Other companies may similarly want to consider how they can mitigate newly imposed tariffs."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_34_995096912#3_2038657550", "doc": {"segment": "Global growth, Gopinath said, is sluggish and precarious, but it does not have to be this way because some of this is self-inflicted.

Gopinath said a major downside risk to the outlook remains an escalation of trade and technology tensions that can significantly disrupt global supply chains. The combined effect of tariffs imposed last year and potential tariffs envisaged in May between the U.S. and China could reduce the level of global gross domestic product in 2020 by 0.5 percent, she said.

These include apparel, consumer packaged goods, agriculture and several others. The application of the tariff would force businesses in these industries to dramatically increase the landed costs associated with their import practices, forcing them to raise their prices or become less competitive in the international market. China’s retaliation has been equal cause for concern, particularly in the U.S. transportation and agricultural industries, which rely heavily on exports to China. Economic Impact\nWhile views vary on the degree to which these trade barriers will impact the U.S. economy, many economists argue the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and/or by China will only serve to destabilize the economy and cause speculation in financial markets. Few believe tariffs will effect change with respect to China’s intellectual property practices and will only serve to drive up costs for businesses on both sides and disrupt the global supply chains on which American multinational businesses rely to remain competitive in international markets.

However, Mr Chan said that the net impact on the Singapore economy and workers are “less easily quantified given the fluidity of the US and China’s tit-for-tat responses”. “Our modelling indicates that based on the tariffs on product lines that have been announced, the net impact is likely to be modest,” he said, but he added that this is with the assumption that there is no further escalation. Bilateral trade between the US and China \"indirectly contributes to 1.1 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP)\", and “any sustained disruption is unwelcome for the region”, he said.

Indeed, macroeconomic factors —including relative aggregate demand and supply in partner countries and their underlying drivers—play a much bigger role than tariffs in determining bilateral trade balances. At the global level, the additional impact of the recently announced and envisaged new US-China tariffs, expected to extend to all trade between those countries, will subtract about 0.3 percent of global GDP in the short term, with half stemming from business and market confidence effects.

Moreover, failure to resolve trade differences and further escalation in other areas, such as the auto industry, which would cover several countries, could further dent business and financial market sentiment, negatively impact emerging market bond spreads and currencies, and slow investment and trade.

More import restrictions would also make tradable consumer goods less affordable, harming low-income households disproportionately.

From Thoreau's words, we can learn that the idea of American Dream became really well-supported and prevalent in this new nation, although the words \"American Dream\" was not invented yet. ﻿\nThe American families in 1920s experienced the happiness and pursued their American Dream\nDuring the mid- to late-1800s, the American news and literature began to use \"the American Dream\" extensively (Kiger, the Origin). These two words were usually related to the ambitious Americans who moved to the West and the Europeans who came to the United States to look for better living conditions (Kiger, The Origin). Before early 1900s, the American Dream also widely used to describe the promotion of people's social classes and the idea of becoming wealthy (Kiger, The Origin). In 1931, Adams published his Epic of America, and the American Dream continued to thrive in the early 1900s\nThe poverty made the American Dream impossible for the Americans\nHowever, the \"Great Depression\" crashed the American Dream during early 1930s by taking away Americans' wealth and making them homeless (Kiger, The Evolution). Many American people were thrown out off their homes and could only making living by begging (Kiger, The Evolution)."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_15_1667833806#5_3301956003", "doc": {"segment": "A Japanese-American Family's Quest for the American Dream\nBy Kiyo Sato\nIn the early 1900s, Shinji Sato left Japan to settle in California.

In “Dreams”, Hughes examines the theme of the importance of not letting go of dreams, because without dreams, life is empty and broken. In “A Dream Deferred”, Hughes examines the important question of what happens when dreams get put off: do they become more powerful, as the struggle for equality did with each passing year?

One of the leading alternatives is the many worlds interpretation, first put forward by Hugh Everett III back in the late 1950s. According to the many worlds view, there is no difference between a particle or system before and after it has been observed, and no separate way of evolving. In fact, the observer himself is a quantum system, which interacts with other quantum systems, with different possible versions seeing the particle or object in different positions, for example. These different versions exist concurrently in different alternative or parallel universes. Thus, each time quantum systems interact with each other, the wave function does not collapse but actually splits into alternative versions of reality, all of which are equally real. This view has the advantage of conserving all the information from wave functions so that each individual universe is completely deterministic, and the wave function can be evolved forwards and backwards. Under this interpretation, quantum mechanics is therefore NOT the underlying reason for the arrow of time.

The role of the observer in quantum mechanics\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, which was the prevailing theory at the time, proposed that atoms or photons exist in multiple states that correspond with different possible outcomes and the possibilites , called superpositions, do not commit to a definite state until they are observed. Schrödinger's thought experiment was designed to show what the Copenhagen interpretation would look like if the mathematical terminology used to explain superposition in the microscopic world was replaced by macroscopic terms the average person could visualize and understand. In the experiment, the observer cannot know whether or not an atom of the substance has decayed, and consequently, does not know whether the vial has broken and the cat has been killed. According to quantum law under the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat will be both dead and alive until someone looks in the box. In quantum mechanics lingo, the cat's ability to be both alive and dead until it is observed is referred to as quantum indeterminacy or the observer's paradox. The logic behind the observer's paradox is the proven ability of observation to influence outcomes. Schrödinger accepted that superposition exists; during his lifetime, scientists were able to prove its existence by studying interference in light waves. Schrödinger wondered, however, about when the resolution of possibilities actually occurs."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_55_410432536#3_918150514", "doc": {"segment": "In fact, most physicists consider this element to be unnecessary and they think that the collapse really just comes from interactions within the system itself.

However, it makes the error of assuming that the collapse has to take prior to the creation of that observer. In fact, the Copenhagen interpretation contains no such requirement. Instead, what would happen according to quantum physics is that the universe could exist as a superposition of states, unfolding simultaneously in every possible permutation, until such a time when an observer springs up in one such possible universe. At the point the observer potentially exists, there is, therefore, an act of observation, and the universe collapses into that state.

Because the collapse of the wave function cannot be undone, and because all the information associated with the initial possible positions of the particle contained in the wave function is essentially lost as soon as it is observed and collapsed, the process is considered to be time-irreversible, which has implications for the so-called “arrow of time”, the one way direction of time that we observe in daily life (see the section on The Arrow of Time ). Some quantum physicists (e.g. Don Page and William Wootters) have developed a theory that time is actually an emergent phenomenon resulting from a strange quantum concept known as entanglement, in which different quantum particles effectively share an existence, even though physically separated, so that the quantum state of each particle can only be described relative to the other entangled particles. The theory even claims to have experimental proof recently, from experiments by Ekaterina Moreva which show that observers do not detect any change in quantum particles (i.e. time foes not “emerge”) until becoming entangled with another particle. Many Worlds Interpretation\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, mentioned above, is not however the only way of looking at it. Frustrated by the apparent failure of the Copenhagen interpretation to deal with questions like what counts as an observation, and what is the dividing line between the microscopic quantum world and the macroscopic classical world, other alternative viewpoints have been suggested. One of the leading alternatives is the many worlds interpretation, first put forward by Hugh Everett III back in the late 1950s. According to the many worlds view, there is no difference between a particle or system before and after it has been observed, and no separate way of evolving. In fact, the observer himself is a quantum system, which interacts with other quantum systems, with different possible versions seeing the particle or object in different positions, for example. These different versions exist concurrently in different alternative or parallel universes."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_27_1211157895#7_2437795048", "doc": {"segment": "According to Bohr, when we observe a quantum object, we affect its behavior.

Bohr's interpretation was widely accepted, and still is by much of the quantum community. But lately, Everett's Many-Worlds theory has been getting some serious attention. Read the next page to find out how the Many-Worlds interpretation works.

Now, there's one way to easily rid ourselves of the problem: The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics could be wrong about the need for a conscious act of observation. In fact, most physicists consider this element to be unnecessary and they think that the collapse really just comes from interactions within the system itself.

Often times, police officers face incredibly violent and difficult situations while in the line of duty. These stressful work conditions, coupled with emotional exhaustion, sometimes result in lives lost. Unfortunately, in the United States, lives lost due to police shooting seems to be an all too common occurrence. Even more tragic is that many times the victims were innocent and posed no direct threat to the responsible police officer. These officers are not likely to face charges other than paid suspension and the police department protects their names 20% of the time. The problem is so common that in 2015, for example, approximately 945 people were killed by police. As of July 2016, an estimated 971 people have died by police fire.

While rare, there have been cases, often involving off-duty police officers, where someone has been able to successfully intervene. In 2007, an off-duty police officer having an early Valentine’s Day dinner with his wife shot and killed an 18-year-old gunman at an Ogden, Utah, mall, stopping a rampage where five people died. “ There is no question that his quick actions saved the lives of numerous other people,” then-police chief Chris Burbank said at the time.

In the early twentieth century, access to higher education was considered to be the exclusive domain of those who were members of the so-called “leisure classes.” The rationale behind this exclusivity was that the American masses engaged in either manufacturing or agricultural labor, and so did not require extensive schooling in the humanities, the arts, or philosophy.

A new expansion of federally-funded unemployment benefits means that many workers filing for unemployment benefits will have access to additional weeks of benefits and larger weekly checks than was available before the pandemic. These expanded benefits can help jobless workers put food on the table for their families while the economy is shut down to slow the spread of the virus. Unemployment benefits are an especially important lifeline for workers of color. Due to racial discrimination in the job market and other structural barriers, workers of color are more likely than white workers to lose their jobs during a recession, and are often the last to benefit from new opportunities once the economy starts to improve.

Additionally, the report points out how funding the additional benefits would increase the federal budget deficit—and leave lasting marks on the economy. “In CBO’s assessment, large deficits tend to slow the growth of the economy in the long term, thereby reducing overall income and the consumption of goods and services in the future,” according to the CBO report.

One of the fundamental requirements of a market analysis is the ability to understand the economics of the location. In order to fully understand the value that a property in its current or planned use brings to a market, one must consider the economics of urban growth patterns as well as the overall market activity and health of the area. Both the current value and forecasted trends in rent, property value, and vacancy depend upon an understanding of how cities grow and how those urban development trends ultimately influence real estate values throughout the city. Of course, cities can grow in many different ways and understanding the patterns of urban growth can help clarify the big picture in a real estate analysis. In this post we’ll discuss several different urban growth models that are commonly used to explain the growth patterns of cities. Concentric Circle Growth in Urban Development\nThe concentric circle growth model, or CCD model, was one of the first theoretical models of urban development. A sociologist named Ernest Burgess first developed this model in 1925.

Concentric circle growth starts with a central business district at the heart of the city. Everything grows up around this central hub of economic activity for the city. The concentric circle growth model is an application of bid-rent theory. Those who are able to pay the highest rents are located near the economic hub of the central business district. Real estate prices are lower as you move away from the central business district, but then people also need to consider transportation time and costs to get to work in the central business district."}}]}

By Shara Tonn\nRich Pedroncelli/AP\nStanford psychology researchers discovered that when white voters perceive more black Americans in the prison population, they support harsher laws. Although African-Americans constitute only 12 percent of America's population, they represent 40 percent of the nation's prison inmates. But informing the white public of this disproportionate incarceration rate may actually bolster support for the very policies that perpetuate the inequality, according to a study published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. Stanford psychology researchers Rebecca Hetey and Jennifer Eberhardt found that when white people were told about these racial disparities, they reported being more afraid of crime and more likely to support the kinds of punitive policies that exacerbate the racial disparities. The expansion of harsh policies – such as California's Three Strikes law and similar measures by other states – has led the United States to have the largest per-capita prison population in the world. \"Most people likely assume this must be due to rising crime rates, but the explosion in the prison population is better explained by harsh criminal justice policies,\" said Hetey, a postdoctoral scholar and the lead author on the study.

The extent of the influence of social media on conflict and political struggle and the mechanisms at play still needs to be captured more systematically. In this article, the author presents a framework to understand how social media can influence political conflict on the level of the elites as well as mass-level collective action. On the level of collective action, the author’s review of literature suggests there is strong evidence that social media can raise awareness and the importance of protest and facilitates groups getting “their story” out. Communication is assisted by social media through the exchange of information, the exposure of wrongdoing by elites, and mobilization and coordination of protest. Connections between activists are made easier, coordination and communication are less costly. Moreover, potential allies and activists can be targeted and recruited—a point primarily examined in the context of political violence and radicalization (e.g. ISIS), but also in the context of nonviolent social movements (e.g. the 2017 Women’s March). Less focus, according to the author, has been placed on how elites/leaders use social media. This is surprising, given that leaders and governments are heavily active on social media to campaign, to gather support for their issues at home and abroad, and to influence and/or bypass traditional media.

Wade, overturning a Texas interpretation of abortion law and making abortion legal in the United States. It was a turning point in women's reproductive rights and has remained a hot-button issue within United States politics ever since. The Roe v. Wade decision held that a woman, with her doctor, could choose abortion in earlier months of pregnancy without legal restriction, based primarily on the right to privacy. In later trimesters, state restrictions could be applied. Fast Facts: Roe v.

Wade (Decision January 22, 1973)\nJanuary 21, 2018\nMariam Morshedi\nThe celebrated and despised Supreme Court case on abortion\nThe issue of abortion raises significant tension in the United States. The issue separates certain religious groups, claiming a fetus’ life has a value equal to that of a born person, from others who place a higher value on the right of a woman to control whether or not she is pregnant. In 1973, the Supreme Court weighed in, as it was presented with a case of a woman wishing to end her pregnancy and a state law preventing the woman from doing so. Our report explains the Roe v. Wade court decision in an infographic. The case\nIn 1971, Norma McCorvey (known in court documents as “Jane Roe”) filed a lawsuit against the attorney general of Texas, Henry Wade. McCorvey argued a Texas law banning abortion, which had been enforced against her, was unconstitutional. The Texas law only allowed abortions if necessary to save the woman’s life. Regulation vs. Liberty\nStates are allowed to regulate a wide variety of actions in the interest of protecting people. But the Constitution limits the states’ rights to regulate. One of those limits is based on an individual’s right to liberty."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_47_156582701#4_307160252", "doc": {"segment": "For example, the Court reasoned that the First Amendment protected the privacy of personal faith, the Fourth Amendment protected the privacy of one’s person and belongings, and so on and so forth. Using this inductive reasoning, the Court concluded that the right to privacy was found in the “penumbras” and “emanations” of the Constitution and that it protected a “right to marital privacy” that unquestionably made the decision to use or forego contraception as a private one. Roe v. Wade and the “Trimester Framework”\nIn Roe v. Wade, the Court was asked to address the question of whether the right to an abortion was similarly covered by the still vaguely defined right to privacy, and if so, to what extent. The trial court that heard the case initially had ruled in favor of Roe. It reasoned that the Ninth Amendment, which states that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution “shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,” protected the right to have an abortion as a right retained by the people and beyond the reach of government. Although the trial court ruled in favor of Roe’s right to have an abortion, it declined to stop the Texas law being challenged from being enforced against others. The case was subsequently appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued its decision in Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973 in which the justices ruled 7-2 that abortion was a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, declared that the right of privacy protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and previously outlined in Griswold “is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” While the Court recognized that a woman’s right to choose was protected by the Constitution, it also recognized the competing state interests of protecting a woman’s health and the “potentiality of human life.”"}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_23_690881184#1_1527553240", "doc": {"segment": "Texas Resident, Jane Roe, wanted to terminate her pregnancy. However, Article 1196 of the Texas Penal Code limited abortions to circumstances when “procured or attempted by medical advice for the purposes of saving the life of the mother.” Claiming the statute unconstitutionally restricted her right to an abortion, Roe sued Texas official Wade in court. Procedural History: The Federal District Court issued declaratory relief and held that the statute was both vague and overbroad. When Roe was not granted Injunctive relief, she appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

Judgment:"}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_29_974227389#4_2236715546", "doc": {"segment": "The Court, in its decision, started by examining the standing of the appellants to file the lawsuit. The Court found a “logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated”, noting that Roe had standing based on her status as a single, pregnant woman who was denied access to an abortion based on the Texas anti-abortion law. It also noted that the fact that Roe’s pregnancy had already ended was irrelevant to the issue of standing because any pregnancy that is the subject of a lawsuit cannot be expected to last to the appellate stage of a case. In evaluating Roe’s argument that the Texas anti-abortion law violated her right to privacy included within the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court balanced the encroachment on the right to privacy involved in denying access to an abortion against the government interest supported by enforcing anti-abortion laws. Roe had argued for relief based on an alleged violation of her right to “personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy\" afforded to her by the Bill of Rights. The Court clarified that, while the “Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy”, the kind of right to personal privacy claimed by Roe is implied by the Fourteenth Amendment and does include the woman’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. The harm to the state in allowing a pregnancy to go forward would pale, the Court noted, in comparison to potential medical harms, psychological harms, or stigmas posed to an individual by an unwanted pregnancy. The Court did not go so far as to say that abortions should be allowed without restriction but, rather, defined a framework within which regulation of abortion would be appropriate. The Court stated that the right to choose to have an abortion is limited by state interests in health issues surrounding pregnancies. The Court’s decision reviewed the historical rationale behind anti-abortion laws, including the government interests regarding “protecting the potentiality of human life” and in “protecting the health of pregnant women”, noting that those interests are time-limited and are not “compelling” for the government until after the first trimester of a pregnancy when a live birth is almost certain."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_53_573361555#2_1196350915", "doc": {"segment": "In Roe v.

The Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade\nThe Supreme Court declared the right to an abortion is a fundamental liberty that the state must have a very strong interest to limit. Our Roe v. Wade infographic describes how the court balanced the liberty/abortion interest of the woman with the state’s interest in prenatal life. The Court ruled that the woman’s liberty right (right to control whether or not she is pregnant) is stronger than the state’s interest in the fetus’ life up until a certain point in the pregnancy. That point is the “point of viability” – when the fetus could survive on its own outside of the womb. After the point of viability, the state’s interest in protecting the fetus outweighs the woman’s choice to terminate her pregnancy. After the point of viability, the Court ruled, a state can prohibit women from getting abortions. What else did the decision say? The Supreme Court added that a state might regulate abortion based on reasons other than the concern for prenatal life."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_23_690881184#8_1527563932", "doc": {"segment": "Dissent (Rehnquist): The right to privacy is not at issue in the present case.

Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), a landmark case decided by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of abortion, is one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history. The court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7 to 2 majority vote in favor of McCorvey. Burger and Douglas' concurring opinion and White's dissenting opinion were issued separately, in the companion case of Doe v. Bolton. The Roe Court deemed abortion a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of strict scrutiny. Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Stenberg v. Carhart, and Gonzales v. Carhart have affected the legal standard. The opinion of the Roe Court, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, declined to adopt the district court's Ninth Amendment rationale, and instead asserted that the \"right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\" Douglas, in his concurring opinion from the companion case Doe v. Bolton, stated more emphatically that, \"The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights.\" Thus, the Roe majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's due process clause. The majority opinion is organized into twelve sections preceded by a brief preface; the first four sections provide background."}}]}

Thirty-five percent of Colorado’s high school students who graduated in 2017 and immediately enrolled in college were not prepared for college-level coursework and required developmental education. Outcomes for students of color and low-income students are even worse; over 55 percent of Colorado’s low-income high school graduates and 52 percent of Hispanic graduates were not ready for college courses in 2017.1\nSome point to a lack of funding as the reason for our education system’s underperformance and inequitable outcomes.

The first anime in the US in the 1990s, was Dragon Quest or Dragon Warrior, based on the video game series with the same name, aired in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in the US by Saban Entertainment. The show was created by Akira Toriyama, the same person who made the Dragon Ball series. The show didn’t do to well in the US and didn’t get a release to home video. Saban Entertainment later dubbed the 1990 anime Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, changed the name to Samurai Pizza Cats, and aired it on ABC in 1991. In 2002, Saban Entertainment rights to the show expired, then Discotek Media obtained the rights and still owns the rights to the series to this day. Viz which was already successful with its manga translation of Rumiko Takahashi ‘s Ranma ½, bought the rights to the anime and released it via direct-to-video starting in 1994. Ranma ½ enjoyed success in the VHS market and was the first anime title in the 1990s to have this level of success and one of the first titles to be recognized as an “anime”.

It creates inequality, which has negative outcomes for those affected by it as well as for society as a whole in the long run. This is because those who are born into situations where they are marginalized (e.g. due to poverty) lack opportunities compared to those born with greater social advantages. In many cases, they suffer unjustly from a lack of having their basic needs met, let alone the opportunity to self-actualize.

In contrast, representations of marginalized group members are largely absent or stereotyped. As such, invisibility places marginalized group members at a disadvantage because once they are rendered invisible, they are denied recognition, power, and voice ( Lewis & Simpson, 2010; Simpson & Lewis, 2005 ). Although the existing literature frames visibility as largely positive and invisibility as generally negative, the papers in this issue (further described below) suggest that there are conditions under which invisibility is preferred to visibility by individuals in marginalized groups ( Rabelo & Mahalingam, 2018; Settles, Buchanan, & Dotson, 2018 ). Differing positive and negative experiences associated with these visibility conditions highlight how the intersection of one's social identity groups shapes experiences. Intersectionality theory states that the meaning of one identity depends on the other identities one holds, and one's experiences are shaped by the power afforded to those identities ( Cole, 2009 ). As such, individuals might be marginalized along some identity dimensions and privileged along others, as in a poor White woman who is marginalized for her gender and social class, but privileged for her race ( Case, 2017 ). Such individuals might find themselves visible, invisible, or hypervisible depending on which identity or identities are salient in a particular situation."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_01_1841363230#1_2723153384", "doc": {"segment": "Marginal production cost is the part of the cost of one unit of production service which would be avoided if that unit were not produced, or which would increase if one extra unit were produced.

Note that variable costs are those which change as output changes - these are treated under marginal costing as costs of the product. Fixed costs, in this system, are treated as costs of the period.

The insidious element here is that even though the non-marginable securities contribute nothing of value to the margin calculation, those same securities — if there is even $1 of debit balance in the margin account — will become registered as “type-2” by virtue of simply residing within a Type-2 acount, and, thus, can be made lendable to brokers for clients wishing to short-sell the stock.

Insane mass murderers, serial killers and spree slayers did exist before the 1900s. You may have heard a lot about modern-day serial killers like Jeffery Dahmer, Ted Bundy and Andrei Chikatilo but surprisingly, these serial killers had much less of a chance of getting away with murder. Before the 1900s, serial killers could easily avoid being caught or found out due to lack of technology and even superstition. Many serial killers in historic times were never caught and remained active. But, what persuades some human beings to carry out horrific act’s towards other human beings? Some say it is mental issues, growing up in a bad childhood or greed. Yet, others say it is distantly in our genes descending from our earliest ancestors as part of survival throughout the complete evolution process. 10. Gilles Garnier\nGilles Garnier (also known as The Werewolf of Dole) was a French serial killer and cannibal for his acts of homicide."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_37_278931139#6_588455156", "doc": {"segment": "In our predominantly secular modernity the prospect of achieving celebrity has become desirable to the extent that it promises to liberate individuals from a powerless anonymity, making them known beyond the limitations of ascribed statuses such as class and family relations. For some this promise of celebrity is merely appealing, while for others it is an all-consuming passion, to the point that not securing some degree of fame can be experienced as a profound failure. Serial killers are not immune to the appeals of celebrity. As Egger (2002) has demonstrated in his analysis of seven of the most notorious American serial killers, the majority ‘seemed to enjoy their celebrity status and thrive on the attention they received’. Hence the complaint of a serial killer to local police is telling: ‘ How many times do I have to kill before I get a name in the paper or some national attention?’ ( Braudy, 1986). Marginalisation\nPerhaps the most terrifying aspect of serial murder is that such killings appear random. This, however, is a misleading characterisation, for while serial killers do target strangers, their victims are not haphazard (Wilson, 2007). Rather, the victims of serial killers tend to mimic the wider cultural categories of denigration characteristic of contemporary society."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_24_341737823#5_727546217", "doc": {"segment": "Edmund Kemper was one serial killer who participated in many interviews. Many serial killers come from unstable childhoods. They have a sense of abandonment and can even be said to have attachment disorder. The lack of discipline, love and boundaries could explain why in later life, they push legal boundaries. They are normally rational and calculating, which aids them to escaping capture for as long as they do. Some show deviant behaviour such as being addictive to pornography. Some will have been involved with the police in their teenage years, due to petty crime. They may even have served shorter sentences before going on to murder. This was especially true with Fred West and Ian Brady, both had been known to the police as teenagers. The crimes they commit are normally arson, petty crime or cruelty to animals."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_50_479538304#13_956518351", "doc": {"segment": "Repeated exposure to something that at first makes you extremely nervous or psychologically affected is likely to trigger you less and less. Notorious serial killers report that this kind of desensitizing happened to them.

For some monstrous serial killers, some degree of desensitizing happens long before their first murder .

Matthew Macon confessed to murdering 7 women in Michigan. As you can see, there are plenty of examples of African American serial killers. Why do white serial killers receive more attention than black serial killers? This is a complex question and there could be a number of reasons behind it. It might be related to what social scientists call “Missing white woman syndrome”. A term that describes the media’s disproportionate coverage of missing middle class white women. In a lot of cases, the victims of black serial killers are also people of color. As a result, their cases may not receive as much attention. In other words, if the victims do not receive widespread attention, then the perpetrator probably won’t either."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_01_2075513252#9_3128864635", "doc": {"segment": "Some would fantasize about mutilating themselves or their genitals. They will even fantasize about their own traumas, over and over again – the difference being that in these fantasies they are the assailant. Serial killers in the making will never discuss these horrid fantasies with anyone, but thoughts of fulfilling them will recur more and more frequently. Before the serial killer kills for the first time, the fantasies normally focus on committing the murder. Afterwards, the fantasies will focus on committing each murder more successfully, and with greater efficiency.

They definitely never experimented as normal teenagers do with sexual activities among their peers, rather preferring masturbation and other auto-erotic activities such as pornography. In some cases there would be obsessive masturbation – as in the case of Andrei Chikatilo, who had awful scarring on his penis due to the aggression that accompanied his masturbation. Without any substantial social structure in his life, the killer is unable to embark on a normal sexual relationship, and thus is forced into solo sexual activities."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_24_341737823#16_727565110", "doc": {"segment": "It is not being caught that causes this, it is because they are stuck in the depression stage of the cycle, not being able to kill again. The ritualistic fantasy is lost. Their victims no longer represent what the killer thought they did. They realise that murder has not erased their past and they can not change the event that resulted in the killing. They then develop a loathing for themselves, which is multiplied from before they started killing. Many people go through horrific life events who do not murder others. These events do not make a serial killer, but a combination of them can make a person more likely to become a killer. It is also fair to conclude that some serial killers have none of these psychological traits, yet still kill. They are characterised as being evil and no other explanation is given. A mind can be evil without abnormality. —"}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_58_1227405194#3_1787155873", "doc": {"segment": "Some of the notable serial killers in the US are David Berkowitz, Edmund Kemper, Larry Bittaker and Roy Norris. Of these, David Berkowitz shot six people and wounded seven others while Edmund Kemper killed more than eight people including his grandparents and mother. Some people theorize that the United States has better record-keeping than some other countries and law enforcement agencies are better at linking murders together. This does hold true for countries like Russia or China in fact, they often do not report them at all unless word somehow gets out to the western press. In Europe, you may also get underreporting because serial killers could be active in multiple countries, and communication between law enforcement between countries is far weaker than internally in a country. However, when compared to Canada or Australia on a per capita basis this actually holds less weight, and the United States has 3 times more serial killers per capita. While this explanation has some merit it's also a traditional political response by American politicians in regards to negative statistics that they are just better at gathering the data. Media saturates coverage when a serial killer is found or a mass killing occurs. Violence sells. While the average consumer sees it, we are shocked, horrified, weep for the families of the victims and the victims themselves but a few see it and think \"cool\"."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_536370055#11_1249295357", "doc": {"segment": "After the kill, the excitement of the killer suddenly drops and he wakes up from his fantasy.

They may collect their victims possessions such as clothes and save news clippings about their crimes. Some serial killer cut off their victims body parts to preserve and/or consume them. Others take pictures or videotape the crime. The trophy is meant to give the murderer the same feelings of power he experienced at the time of the kill and to remind himself/herself that the fantasy is real, and he/she really did fulfill it. 7. Depression Phase\nThe last phase before the serial killer starts over again is phase seven, the depression phase. There is a great emotional let down for the killer.

Jeffrey Dahmer \"Milwaukee Cannibal”). Sometimes the most intense thrill for the serial killer comes from knowing that they are the cause of the fear of the people in the towns where they operate. They get a deep satisfaction from the feeling of being in control of media, law enforcement and citizens (Dennis Rader “Bind, Torture, Kill,” David Berkowitz “Son of Sam\"). Although many serial killers rape their victims before killing them (Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway “The Green River Killer,\" John Gacy “The killer clown,” Michael Ross \"The Roadside Strangler\"), it is not usually sexual satisfaction by itself that motivates them but the control they feel when mercilessly taking what is not theirs. As defects in the regulation of the dopamine system can be genetically determined, this characteristic is yet another potential genetic factor that may contribute to the chances of someone becoming a serial killer. How to Make a Monster\nBut sometimes what people who raise the nature-or-nurture question really want to know is not the degree to which genes are responsible for making serial killers but, rather, whether a person who has no genetic predisposition could become a serial killer. It is unlikely that we will ever have a definite answer to this question. But there are several reasons to think that some serial killers have no genetic predisposition to kill intentionally but are created purely by their environment. One reason is that the heritability of the exact composition of traits that lead people to kill in malicious ways and on multiple occasions is bound to be extremely low."}}]}
