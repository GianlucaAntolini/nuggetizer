Berdaches married other ordinary men (not Berdaches), although neither was considered homosexual, as they would be in today’s Western culture. What this suggests is that we learn gender through the process of socialization. For many people, this process begins before they are even born, with parents selecting gendered names on the basis of the sex of a fetus, and by decorating the incoming baby's room and selecting its toys and clothes in color-coded and gendered ways that reflect cultural expectations and stereotypes. Then, from infancy on, we are socialized by family, educators, religious leaders, peer groups, and the wider community, who teach us what is expected from us in terms of appearance and behavior based on whether they code us as a boy or a girl. Media and popular culture play important roles in teaching us gender too. One result of gender socialization is the formation of gender identity, which is one’s definition of oneself as a man or woman."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_1163067328#3_2419876387", "doc": {"segment": "However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) are considered masculine.

Researchers found that across cultures, individualistic traits were viewed as more masculine; however, collectivist cultures rated masculine traits as collectivist and not individualist (Cuddy et al., 2015). These findings provide support that gender stereotypes may be moderated by cultural values. There are two major psychological theories that partially explain how children form their own gender roles after they learn to differentiate based on gender.

A Note on the Causes and Types of Media Bias\nBias in media can also reflect different types of prejudices or preconceived unfavorable feeling or negative evaluation or opinion toward a certain person based on his or her group or sociocultural membership. Some types of bias in the media are intentional. A number of editors and reporters have the propensity to deliberately commit partiality because of their personal stances. However, some incidents of bias are unintentional. For example, cognitive biases result from the inability of a media person to demonstrate objectivity and make necessary judgments because of the limitations of his or her cognitive processes. These limitations may be due to predefined preferences or having a certain frame of mind that unconsciously affects the way a particular story is presented. Another example is when a reporter lacks competencies in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data or facts, thereby resulting in misinterpretation and misrepresentations. This results in an ineffective and inefficient presentation of a story, issues, or the surrounding facts."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_01_673809968#11_665789793", "doc": {"segment": "In the 1980s, the South African government accused newspapers of liberal bias and ordered censorship over them, shutting one down for a time.

During the civil rights movement, production companies were accused of bias against mixed-race storylines. Some southern stations refused to air shows with mixed casts such as Star Trek and I Spy. Here are the types of bias you can find in the media: Advertising bias consists of selecting media stories based on what will please advertisers. For example, what if an online news outlet's biggest sponsor was a major airline? The outlet may choose only to highlight positive stories relating to that airline and only negative incidents regarding other airlines.

There was a focus on more environmental explanations of homicide in the early to mid 20th century, largely in reaction to the previous focus on intra-individual explanations of homicidal behavior. Environmental Theories of Homicide\nEnvironmental theories can be described generally as focusing on sources or causes of homicidal behavior outside the individual. Examples of such theories include socialization theories, symbolic interactionism, social structural theories, control theory, and social ecology theory. Socialization theories of homicide and aggression have historically been among the most popular and influential accounts of the motivations for homicide. The sex difference in the commission of violent crimes— including homicide—was one of the first and most obvious observations demanding explanation. Men are more often than women both the offenders and the victims of homicides. Socialization theories argue that men, more than women, have been socialized to view aggression as a permissible means to achieve certain ends. This differential socialization for aggressive behavior in men and women, it is argued, can explain the greater homicide rates among men. While this theory has been well received within psychology, there is growing evidence that an exclusive reliance on this theoretical position to explain homicide patterns leads to incomplete conclusions."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_39_528214426#1_1136576959", "doc": {"segment": "This essay we will provide an epidemiological assessment of victimization against the elderly based on U.S. statistics and show how this victimization varies across the life course.

He even teamed up with Lady Gaga (watch the video of their conversation above) to talk about PTSD and depression after Mother Monster penned an open letter, which she posted on her Born This Way blog, about battling PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and how she has benefited from both psychotherapy and psychiatric medication, and from openly talking about her struggles. The pair mused about how important it is to publicly address mental health issues, which goes a long way toward dispelling the stigma that surrounds depression and anxiety. Because, being alone in the darkness is the worst part. If you study the effect eclipses have on people born during them, it's no surprise Prince William is becoming a positive leader for mental health awareness because people born during an eclipse are natural born leaders. The June 21, 1982 solar eclipse in Cancer that occurred when Prince William was born emphasized \"a powerful drive to care for, cherish and protect others, and a strong need to give and receive emotional safety, privacy, and security that is focused on personal relationships,\" Rick Levine noted on Daily Planet Pulse."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_33_480892307#14_1036233526", "doc": {"segment": "Avoid going outdoors during an eclipse\nMyth\nThere is no scientific basis to this, nor does Ayurveda state any such restriction.

Meditate during a solar eclipse\nFact\nWhile it is a good habit to meditate daily, especially in the morning, it is specifically advisable to meditate during a solar eclipse. This is because of the connection that the mind has with the moon and the body has with the earth. As the sun is connected to both the mind and body, when all three celestial bodies are aligned, so is the body with the mind, making it a perfect time to meditate. Also, as eating is not advised during a solar eclipse, an empty stomach is conducive to meditation.

Due to past government subsidies of oil production, the people of Venezuela have historically relied heavily on imports of even basic necessities rather than domestic production. Now that Venezuela’s borders have been closed and its currency devalued, imported resources within Venezuela have become increasingly scarce, making food prices rise significantly. Population and Inflation\nApproximately 81 percent of Venezuela’s 31.5 million people are now considered to be living in income poverty, while over 50 percent are estimated to be living in extreme poverty. Additionally, the IMF predicts that inflation will reach 13,000 percent in the coming year, making it the biggest recession in the history of the Western Hemisphere — twice as large as the Great Depression. Education Decline\nFor a country that once boasted free education for all students under Hugo Chavez’s socialist regime, the education structure in Venezuela is crumbling under the current economic crisis. Many schools in Venezuela have closed or are operating at limited capacity. Such conditions are due to insufficient salaries for school teachers who are working for just over a dollar a month, as well as lack of school lunches as the government has run out of funds for the state-run program that provided children with free lunch.

In 2012, the government introduced some changes in their school lunch programs. There were some good updates like the inclusion of healthy fruits in the meal, lowering the quantity of sodium and fat in the meals, and also serving different kinds of meals to different grades of students. However, budget constraints and bureaucracy leave many kids with unappetizing, unripe, and overall unappealing options (if healthier). Because of this, many students skip lunch, eat less, or begrudgingly take the food, which is still often of lower quality and health standards than a growing child requires.

The major elements of social movements are their emergence and recruitment, collective identities, frames or discourses, organizations, tactics or actions, and external contexts or political opportunities. Each of these elements is gendered. First, movements’ emergence and processes of recruitment are gendered because the status of women and men shapes their differential ability and willingness to organize on their own behalf. Gendered factors such as family structures and responsibilities, access to higher education, paid employment, and fertility rate all affect recruitment and participation in activism. These factors all vary according to race, class, and nationality as well as gender, and also change over time; such variations account for some of the differences in the level and form of women’s mobilization cross culturally and historically. Further, social movements emerge along gendered lines because they emerge from gendered preexisting organizations and networks (Taylor 1999). For example, feminist organizing during the late 1960s in the US emerged partially from the Civil Rights Movement, in which women gained organizing experience and an ideology opposing inequality, but also faced gender barriers to full participation.

In movements that explicitly challenge the gendered status quo, such differences may be much less marked or even at times inverted; while in movements that seek to restore traditional gender roles, they may be exaggerated. Fifth, tactics and strategies are affected by gender. Women and men may draw on established social activities in order to work for change, as in men’s use of violent intimidation compared with women’s reliance on boycotts and vicious gossip in the US racist movement of the 1920s (Blee 1991). Here, too, incorporating tactics grounded in traditionally feminine activities into social movement theory suggests a broader definition of tactics and strategies that includes actions previously not seen as part of social movements. Sixth, gendered external social structures and mainstream culture delimit the opportunities and constraints for social movements.

Women have organized in ‘‘mothers’ movements’’ to challenge governmental killings and disappearances of their children (such as the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina), or to fight against environmental degradation or for better public education. Such ‘‘maternalist politics’’ can uphold traditional definitions of women’s place while simultaneously expanding those definitions, bringing women into the public sphere and often changing activists’ own family relations and identities. Men’s movements, such as the mythopoetic movement, also organize men around some traditional definitions of masculinity while simultaneously stretching those definitions by, for example, encouraging men to express emotions more freely (Schwalbe 1996). Further, movements do not have to be oriented around gender to be shaped by it. Because gender is a central feature of social structure, culture, and daily life, all movements are gendered. The major elements of social movements are their emergence and recruitment, collective identities, frames or discourses, organizations, tactics or actions, and external contexts or political opportunities. Each of these elements is gendered. First, movements’ emergence and processes of recruitment are gendered because the status of women and men shapes their differential ability and willingness to organize on their own behalf. Gendered factors such as family structures and responsibilities, access to higher education, paid employment, and fertility rate all affect recruitment and participation in activism."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_28_732640201#8_1571164357", "doc": {"segment": "Often they may do both, as in the case of maternalist movements that draw on women’s special place as mothers to argue for a greater influence by women on national affairs. Fourth, social movements’ organizational structures are gendered. For example, the American Civil Rights Movement assigned formal leadership to men while assigning women to more informal leadership roles (Robnett 1997). Recognizing these differences entails not only recognizing discrimination within the movement and bringing to light the previously unacknowledged role of women, but also redefining theories of leadership to include the ways that women exercise influence outside of official leadership positions. Beyond leadership, women and men may take on different tasks within movement organizations, with women taking more responsibility for activities such as providing food for events or monitoring the emotional climate at meetings, and men under taking more public speaking, drafting of position papers, or providing ‘‘peacekeeping’’ at public demonstrations. Gendered divisions of labor within movements vary considerably across time, space, and among movements, of course. In movements that explicitly challenge the gendered status quo, such differences may be much less marked or even at times inverted; while in movements that seek to restore traditional gender roles, they may be exaggerated. Fifth, tactics and strategies are affected by gender.

As air conditioning became more prolific in the 1960s, electric systems took the lead because of lower capital costs, good efficiency and very low electric rates. Throughout the 1970s, use of electric air conditioning increased while natural gas air conditioning declined, and by 1990, only five percent of all air conditioning in the United States was fueled by natural gas. However, as energy became more scarce and costly during the 1980s, numerous manufacturers both here and in Asia accelerated the development of more efficient natural gas air conditioning. By 1991, nearly 30 percent of Japan's existing air conditioning needs and 65 percent of new installations were met by natural gas.

The private prisons include Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC), which can accommodate over 85,000 prisoners (Gaines & Miller, 2006). On the one hand, the duty of the public prisons is to ensure the due rehabilitative process through the integration of various programs that address the unique needs of each prisoner.

These programs feature different psychosocial tests and exercises, educational programs and development of technical skills that can enable the prisoners acquire competitive skills to be used once they are released.

The spiral of silence theory suggests that when people think they are in the majority in a certain setting, they will more freely express their opinion than those who see themselves as in the minority, and may fear social ostracism if they express an unpopular opinion. Thus, although individuals may not make sexist or racist comments offline, they may feel it’s okay to do so in a particular online setting because they think their opinion is the prevalent one there. 4. Social identity salience. The social identity model of deindividuation effects, commonly referred to as the SIDE model, suggests that online, social identity sometimes means more than our individual identity.

The term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony which are uncorroborated by objective, independent evidence such as notarized documentation, photographs, audio-visual recordings, etc. When used in advertising or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a testimonial, which are highly regulated or banned in some jurisdictions. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g. in the use of case studies in medicine. Other anecdotal evidence, however, does not qualify as scientific evidence, because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method. Where only one or a few anecdotes are presented, there is a larger chance that they may be unreliable due to cherry-picked or otherwise non-representative samples of typical cases. Similarly, psychologists have found that due to cognitive bias people are more likely to remember notable or unusual examples rather than typical examples.

To what extent can a qualitative research project utilise this evidence as: 1) the basis of hypotheses; 2) evidence in support of hypotheses. In Brokerage and Closure, Burt (2004) for example, occasionally refers to anecdotal evidence to support his theoretical models. e.g. \"Evidence on adaptive implementation is primarily in the form of anecdotes, in part because the processes by which people bridge structural holes are so varied and sensitive to context.\" Qualitative Social Research\nGet help with your research\nJoin ResearchGate to ask questions, get input, and advance your work."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_50_390683302#3_812089946", "doc": {"segment": "Some social psychologists utilize their expertise developing solutions to current social problems.

A president can be said to have this kind of mandate when his popular support is such that other people in the political system feel compelled to help him do things that he wants to do, and that they don’t. The strength of a newly elected or reelected president’s legislative mandate can be measured by how afraid senators and representatives are that their constituents will punish them for opposing him. That kind of fear becomes even more important as bipartisan norms of comity continue to degrade at a rapid pace. A legislative mandate is irrelevant if you have enough votes to pass things through Congress just with the support of people who already agree with you. Ronald Reagan needed, and had, a mandate on economic and budget issues in 1981, just as FDR did in 1932: While he had the votes of people who believed in Reaganomics, a fair number of wavering Democrats went along with Reagan, across party lines, because they felt the voters wanted them to. ( In one famous anecdote, Reagan got a Pennsylvania Democrat to vote for his tax-cut plan by calling into a radio show and asking for his support live on the air.) Barack Obama had a similar mandate in 2009, but never really tested its limits on Republicans — he had the votes of his own party to do whatever he wanted, so he was able to pass the stimulus with the support of only three Republican senators and no Republicans in the House, and to pass Obamacare without any GOP support whatsoever."}}]}

Through the use of motivational interviewing techniques and the development of a therapeutic rapport, the SOTAP has seen a dramatic increase in the rates of higher risk sex offenders volunteering to participate in the treatment program. Due to the increase in higher risk offenders volunteering to participate in the program, the SOTAP has not had sufficient capacity to allocate treatment resources to lower risk offenders.

Offenders admitted to the sex offender treatment programs must meet the following criteria: The offender must have been convicted of a sex offense for his or her current or a previous term of incarceration. He or she must be eligible for release at some future date. He or she must acknowledge/recall having committed at least one sex offense. He or she must agree to attend SOTAP and follow treatment rules and expectations. Treatment priority is given to higher risk offenders. Sentence structure, court ordered treatment, and release date dictate additional prioritization practices. The program is approximately 9-12 months in duration and typically occurs in the last 12-18 months of the participant's incarceration. Offenders can be terminated from treatment for assaults and fighting, sexual behavior that cannot be managed through formal interventions, intentionally violating confidentiality, failing to make progress in treatment, being placed in a higher security category than that allowable by the treatment facility such as maximum, engaging in behaviors that are disruptive to the operation of the program and/or institution, or using illicit substances."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_15_797779597#1_1592438696", "doc": {"segment": "1.3.C.12 Sex Offender Registration 1.4.A.3 Sex Offender Management Program 1.4.B.9 Sexual Behavior Issue Review\nDo sex offenders receive treatment while in prison? Yes. The sex offender treatment program operated through the DOC is known as the Special Treatment of Perpetrators (STOP) program. The STOP Program consists of therapy, educational treatment and relapse prevention. Failure to take part or complete STOP can negatively impact an inmate's parole and classification level. Those inmates who are terminated from or refuse treatment while in prison may have their visits restricted, may be classified to a higher level and may jeopardize their parole release. The Sex Offender Management Program (SOMP) operated by the DOC includes sex offender specific assessments, Admissions & Orientation psychosexual screens, STOP programming, psychosexual reports, community release planning, assistance in community supervision, development and promotion of a community treatment provider network, and sex offender community treatment and supervision standards.

Prison–Based Sex Offender Treatment\nThe majority of states offer some form of prison–based sex offender  treatment in one or more of their facilities (West, Hromas, & Wenger,  2000). In some jurisdictions, correctional agencies are legislatively or otherwise  mandated to maintain treatment programs and, in some instances, legislation  requires sex offenders to participate in these programs in order to be considered  for conditional release or parole. Regardless, although prison–based  sex offender treatment programs are generally available, their actual capacity  may be quite limited (see, e.g., Gordon & Hover, 1998; West et al., 2000). These capacity concerns, coupled with the ever–increasing numbers of  convicted sex offenders entering prisons (Harrison & Beck, 2006), mean  that it will be a greater challenge to ensure that all of the sex offenders  who can benefit from prison–based treatment will be able to access it. To increase availability, capacity, and accessibility, program administrators  and staff have begun to develop a range of prison–based sex offender–specific  interventions that vary in nature and intensity (see, e.g., Gordon & Hover,  1998; Marshall et al., 2006b;"}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_00_1257140584#5_2245948171", "doc": {"segment": "and\nSupport from key stakeholders throughout the system. Availability, Capacity, and Accessibility\nBecause adult and juvenile sex offenders are diverse populations with varied  levels of risk and needs, jurisdictions should have a continuum of treatment  services available, ranging from an array of options in the community, to services  in group homes and moderate care facilities, and ultimately including treatment  in secure correctional or residential facilities (see, e.g., Bengis, 1997; Berenson & Underwood, 2000; Hunter, Gilbertson, Vedros, & Morton, 2004; Marshall et al., 2006a; Schwartz, 2003). Keeping in mind that interventions  are more likely to reduce recidivism when matched to the level of risk posed  by individuals, community–based sex offender treatment is more likely  to be effective for low risk offenders; more intensive treatment within correctional  or juvenile justice facilities is best reserved for those who pose a higher  risk for recidivism (see, e.g., Berenson & Underwood, 2000; Friendship,  Mann, & Beech, 2003;"}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_1365676800#11_2799446105", "doc": {"segment": "If you were found not guilty, then you can reach out to an attorney and find out the next steps for getting the arrest record expunged. Otherwise, misdemeanors take one year to qualify for expungement, and felonies take three years. The process usually requires getting a hearing from a court. If the court grants an expungement, an order will be sent to private companies and agencies to destroy the criminal record. Can a sex offender get off the registry in Texas? It is possible to remove oneself from the sex offender registry in Texas. Approval must be acquired from the Texas Council, and an assessment of the likelihood of reoffending must be provided by a professional. Additionally, the offender must have completed the required counseling and treatment from the Sex Offender Treatment Program. Violent sex offenses are unable to be cleared, however. The types of crimes eligible for deregistration are prostitution, possession of child pornography, indecent exposure, and solicitation of a minor."}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_50_1125175077#19_1875212754", "doc": {"segment": "Yes, there is violence and yes people get killed, but far less than in state prisons. That is the way they designed the system. The Feds want the murderers and rapists in state prisons where life is miserable and there is a lot more violence. Maybe, they feel like that is what they deserve for their crimes. Me, I don't judge anybody. I do know that I have been locked up with some innocent people and that really, really sucks. As for child molester and kiddie porn offenders. they all go to various facilities and all go into the SOMP (sex offender management program) . They do not go into general population ) and they usually go to one of a handful of low-medium level facilities that have treatment programs and are housed with similar offenders.
