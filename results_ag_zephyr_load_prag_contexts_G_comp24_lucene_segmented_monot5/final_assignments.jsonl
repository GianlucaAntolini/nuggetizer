Individualization refers to the increasing focus on individual characteristics and behaviors that contribute to violent crime. While these theories were initially developed to explain intra-individual factors influencing homicidal behavior, there has been a shift towards environmental explanations in response. One potential environmental factor contributing to the homicide rate is the influence of socialization theories on aggressive behavior in men. However, relying solely on this perspective may lead to incomplete conclusions, as evidenced by the example of elderly individuals. According to the provided context, homicide victims sixty-five or older were more vulnerable to intimates and other relatives, and they were 50% less likely to be killed by intimates compared to those aged between twelve and sixty-four. This socio-occupational effect highlights the importance of considering factors beyond individual characteristics in understanding the relationship between individualization and homicide rates.

Critics argue that if prostitution were legal, the concept of crime would not exist in this context, and the term \"crime\" should not be used in this paragraph.

{"query": "how movements win gendered opportunity structures", "qid": "2024-67021", "answer_text": "Gendered opportunity structures play a significant role in how movements achieve success in winning societal changes. According to McCammon et al. (2001, p. 49), gendered movements emerge from preexisting organizations and networks, shaped by the status of women and men. Variations in gender dynamics affect recruitment, participation, and the emergence of movements (McCammon et al., 2003, p. 787). Gendered differences in labor, recruitment, and tactics are evident across time, space, and movements (Taylor, 1999). For example, women's suffrage movements in the U.S. between 1866 and 1919 faced challenges in mobilizing women due to traditional gender roles and expectations (McCammon et al., 2001, p. 49). The Civil Rights Movement contributed to the emergence of feminist organizing in the late 1960s, which faced gender barriers (Taylor, 1999). Gendered divisions of labor vary across movements and change over time, reflecting the movement's objectives (Taylor, 1999). For instance, women's reliance on nonviolent tactics like boycotts contrasts with men's use of violent intimidation within the racist movement of the 1920s (Blee, 1991). This highlights the importance of incorporating a broader definition of tactics and strategies in social movement theory, including less conventional approaches. External social structures, including political institutions and mainstream culture, also impact movements by creating opportunities and constraints based on gender (Taylor, 1999). Women and men face different access to the state, both as elected officials and outside activists. Gendered structures, procedures, and discourses within institutions form the boundaries and opportunities for movements (Schutt & Wheeler, 2003). Understanding these gendered dynamics is crucial to understanding how movements win and achieve their goals. In summary, gendered opportunity structures influence the emergence, recruitment, tactics, and external context of social movements. By acknowledging and analyzing these dynamics, we can better understand how movements achieve victories in challenging societal norms and changing existing power structures.", "response_length": 298, "run_id": "results_ag_zephyr_load_prag_contexts_G_comp24_lucene_segmented_monot5.json", "nuggets": [{"text": "Gender is central to social structure and movements", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Movements are gendered in emergence and recruitment", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Access to education influences gendered recruitment", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Women's suffrage movements shaped by political opportunities", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Gendered external structures limit movement opportunities", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Political opportunity structures influence activism outcomes", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Historical context shapes women's mobilization strategies", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Gender regimes affect access to political power", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Collective identities in movements are gendered", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Social movements challenge traditional gender roles", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Movements can emerge from preexisting gendered networks", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Gender shapes discourses in social movements", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Gendered structures affect institutional engagement", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Grassroots movements foster multiracial gender solidarity", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Political opportunity structures are analytical concepts", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Emergence of women's movements linked to social reform", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Gender influences organizational structures in movements", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Family structures affect women's activism participation", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Gendered divisions of labor vary across movements", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Tactics in movements often reflect gender norms", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Maternalist politics expand women's public roles", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Men's movements can redefine masculinity", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Civil Rights Movement influenced feminist organizing", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Women's roles often informal in leadership", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Gendered tactics include boycotts and intimidation", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Activism varies by race, class, and nationality", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Political responsiveness linked to women's suffrage", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Historical battles shaped women's societal roles", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Activism can transform family relations and identities", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Women's suffrage movements from 1866 to 1919", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}]}
{"query": "why nursing should borrow theories from other disciplines", "qid": "2024-224013", "answer_text": "Nursing can benefit greatly from borrowing theories from other disciplines due to the unique perspectives and insights they provide. According to McEwen and Wills (2014), borrowed theories, primarily from sociology and other associated fields, focus on the interactions between individuals and society, as these relationships have a significant impact on an individual's well-being and health. By incorporating borrowed theories into nursing practice, nurse leaders can better understand the broader context and the consequences of their decisions on the organization, its employees, and patients. Using borrowed theories in conjunction with nursing theories allows for a more holistic approach to nursing practice and research. This is especially important when dealing with complex issues and phenomena that cannot be fully addressed by nursing-specific theories alone. Nurses may examine borrowed theories for congruence with nursing ideals and situations, ensuring that the integration of these theories aligns with the values and principles of nursing. Borrowed theories have played a significant role in nursing theory development, as they have formed the basis for numerous nursing theories. For example, Nightingale's Notes, a nursing model focusing on environmental rules, served as a foundation for the development of nursing-specific theories, incorporating ideas from other disciplines. Borrowed theories, thus, contribute to the development of nursing knowledge by providing a broader perspective and addressing the complexities of nursing practice. In summary, nursing can greatly benefit from borrowing theories from other disciplines, as they offer unique insights and perspectives that can inform and guide nursing practice and research. Through the integration of borrowed theories with nursing theories, nursing professionals can create a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between individuals, society, and health.", "response_length": 272, "run_id": "results_ag_zephyr_load_prag_contexts_G_comp24_lucene_segmented_monot5.json", "nuggets": [{"text": "Nursing borrows theories from other disciplines for guidance", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Borrowed theories enhance nursing research and practice", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Over 45% of nursing dissertations use non-nursing theories", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Borrowed theories can improve patient care and satisfaction", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Theories must align with nursing ideals for effective application", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Borrowed theories form part of nursing's theoretical DNA", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "General systems theory and social cognitive theory are commonly borrowed", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Critically examining borrowed theories is essential for nursing practice", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Examples include sociology, psychology, and organizational systems", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Wilbur's integrated theory aids nursing leadership", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Nursing theory development began in the 1950s", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}, {"text": "Nightingale's Notes focused on environmental nursing rules", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}]}

Inmates who participate in these programs often enter prison without a high school diploma, which limits their opportunities and contributes to their involvement in criminal activities. Programs such as the Second Chance Pell Pilot provide inmates with access to Pell grants, offering a valuable opportunity for education.

{"query": "why do people not express their opinions", "qid": "2024-217582", "answer_text": "Opinions are free, but not mandatory, and people may choose not to express their opinions due to various reasons. One reason is to avoid negative feedback or spam, as not all comments are supportive or beneficial. Disabling comments across all channels can be a result of moderation taking up excessive time. Additionally, some individuals may be too timid or have had negative experiences expressing their opinions, leading them to conceal their thoughts or add extra elements to make themselves appear less intelligent. Being too judgmental or smoking can also influence a person's reluctance to express their opinions. Passive-aggressive communication is often ineffective as it beats around the bush, wasting time with unclear messages. Assertive communication is considered the most effective style as it expresses thoughts politely and considers other opinions. The Spiral of Silence Model illustrates how the number of people with divergent opinions decreases over time, leading to the perceived majority opinion becoming the actual majority opinion, discouraging the expression of diverse opinions.", "response_length": 164, "run_id": "results_ag_zephyr_load_prag_contexts_G_comp24_lucene_segmented_monot5.json", "nuggets": [{"text": "Fear of isolation discourages opinion expression", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Spiral of Silence model explains declining willingness to speak", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Perceived majority opinion influences expression", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "People may feel their opinions are not valued", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Clarity in communication is essential for expression", "importance": "vital", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Passive communication leads to unexpressed opinions", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Low self-esteem contributes to silence", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Timidity can undermine opinion confidence", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Passive-aggressive communication is ineffective", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Moderation of feedback can be overwhelming", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "support"}, {"text": "Negative feedback is often more emphasized", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "partial_support"}, {"text": "Social identity can alter online behavior", "importance": "okay", "assignment": "not_support"}]}

{"query": "are presidential mandates a real thing or is it a myth", "qid": "2024-5809", "answer_text": "The presidential mandate, which claims that a majority of all voters prefer a president's policies, is not a real thing according to political scientist Robert A. Dahl in his 1990 article, \"The Myth of the Presidential Mandate.\" Presidents often rely on their election victory to convince Congress to comply with their policies, but this does not grant them the power to override the Constitution. The Electoral College, rather than creating a national campaign inclusive of rural areas and giving a stronger mandate to govern, actually reinforces the winner-take-all nature at the state level. This can lead to the perception of landslide victories, as seen in examples like Ronald Reagan (1980) and Bill Clinton (1992 and 1996). The key issue in understanding the United States political system is the gap between the promises and actions of a president, which can create an illusion of a presidency, rather than the actual reality.

{"query": "how do sex offenders get out of treatment facilities", "qid": "2024-38611", "answer_text": "Sex offenders get out of treatment facilities through the Sex Offender Management Program (SOMP), which is an institutional designation created by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. SOMP prisons have a more robust Psychology Department, a Sex Offender Treatment Program (either residential or non-residential), and a higher percentage of sexual offenders in the general population. There are two types of treatment programs available at SOMP facilities: the 9 to 12 month Non-Residential Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP-NR) and the 12 to 18 month Residential Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP-R). Participation in treatment programs can lessen the risk of being civilly committed, but disclosures made during treatment can be used as evidence of the need for civil commitment. At SOMP facilities, sex offenders don't have to worry about prison politics and their safety since the state is offering adequate treatment through its Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP). Approximately 1/3 of inhabitants at these facilities take part in the SOTP, which aims to manage sex offender issues. Since 2006, 179 patients have been unconditionally released from CSH, as they no longer meet the criteria identifying them as sexually violent predators and can live freely, although registered as sex offenders. However, inmates at facilities like Coalinga State Hospital argue that they are being treated poorly, with the state allegedly using the facility as an internment camp rather than providing adequate treatment. The patients claim that the facility refuses to monitor their symptoms, offer a minimum of 20 hours per week of treatment, or conform to the Mayberg consent decree that resulted from a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.
